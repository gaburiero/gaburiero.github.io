# Introduction

I have a bachelor in Computer Engineer at the Federal University of Pará (Belém, Pará, Brazil) where my focus was FPGA developing for telecommunications applications. In the Graduation Period I also spent one year at the University of Electro-Communications in Tokyo Japan as a part of exchange program sponsored by the Brazillian government, called "Science Without Borders". I am currently a Master student at Federal University of ABC where I am studying and developing applications of huma-computer interaction with gesture recognition.
